# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name
my_name = "Parker Thomson"

puts "#{my_name}"

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
# YOUR CODE HERE
puts "#{my_name} has a house elf named #{house_elf}."
# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
# YOUR CODE HERE
hogwarts = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts "#{hogwarts}"
# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students_2021 = 22 + 2
# YOUR CODE HERE
p "We had #{students_2021} in total here last year."

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
students_2022 = 22 - 2
puts "We had #{students_2022} in total this year."


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Parker"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 1
puts "#{first_name} has #{number_of_pets} pet!"
puts "And if you ask if hes hungery he would say #{is_hungry}."
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.
# for first_name i made it a string since it was a name,
# for is_hungry I also made that a because it was a true or false statement
# for number_of_pets I used an integer since I was placing a number for the variable




# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to
# different values (but same data type).
# Print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Querc"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 0

puts "#{first_name} has #{number_of_pets} pets because hes Parkers dog."
puts " if you ask him if he is hungry he would bark #{is_hungry} but we know thats a lie"

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out
# to the terminal as you would expect?
