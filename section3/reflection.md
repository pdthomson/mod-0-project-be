## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

Honestly working for that short of a time and taking a little break felt like I was cutting things short because I was just getting into my groove and that I was walking away when I was really getting into my work.  I felt like I walked away at a bad time and would prefer to work longer before taking a break.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I am pretty good about timing myself on things and breaking it into sections to see what takes me more time and then I like to look back and figure out why it took me more time. I was good about setting my intentions for a session and getting thru what I set out to get done, I actually feel like things got done faster when I broke it up like that. I didn't feel too distracted and felt very focused because each goal was small enough to really see the end in sight and made it easy to just focus on the task at hand.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

A hash is list of unique keys and their values.  It is different from and array because and array is a list of objects but nothing else. A hash allows you to assign any object type to the value.  That value being a "key" the hash will store the key and the value, the learning ruby the hard way used the example of it being like a dictionary.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {
  "Dog food" => 50,
  "Cat food" => 50,
  "Hamsters" => 15,
  "Reptiles" => 25,
  "Fish" => 150
}
```
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value "Iowa"?

```
print "#{states["IA"]}"
```
**Running that will print out 'Iowa'**

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```
print "#{states}"
```


  **Running this will print the entire array keys and values**

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Another example of a hash would be like a court date base website. It would store a lot of information at one time about one person like height, weight, eye color, nationality, address.  All things you would want to store into a hash and could not use an array to make.  A hash is better than an array because it allows you to house additional information about what you would put into an array allowing you to call on additional data and store a multitude of information at one spot in nice neat organized way.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

When I was doing additional googling there just seemed to be a lot of mode pairings that could go along with a hash and I went to deep down a rabbit hole to fast and am just excited to see more ways to wrap if statements and a whole lot of things into my hashes.
